sort1 uses:  Bubble Sort

How do you know?: The time complexity is significantly less in case of sorted.


sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: The time complexity is less than other two and the time complexity is somewhat identical in all cases.


sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: The time complexity is along the spectrum with first one alebit faster but there is no optimization on time complexity in case of sorted.
